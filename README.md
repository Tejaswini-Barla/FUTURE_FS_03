NETFLIX CLONE
A Netflix clone on GitHub is a practice project replicating Netflix's core features like user authentication, video streaming, and responsive UI. Built with React, Firebase, or Node.js, it helps developers learn frontend/backend integration. Common features include movie browsing, trailers, and dynamic content rendering. Open-source clones often include tutorials for setup and customization. Hosting via GitHub Pages or Firebase demonstrates deployment skills.
